# Mktmindz_Dashboard
I have developed a marketing dashboard for Marketmindz research. The first slide details campaign performance, highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) that show revenue from various products. Overall, we earned Rs 1 million, with Campaign 6 being the most successful, generating 334 orders. In contrast, Campaign 2 had the fewest orders.

Regarding product demand, wine emerged as the most successful product across all six campaigns. The chart illustrates that most customers prefer purchasing from our stores.

The second slide focuses on buyer composition. We have 2,240 customers who purchased our products, with an average age of 56 years and an average income of Rs 52,000. This slide also provides insights into buyer marital status, highest education level, and how our customers' tastes and preferences have evolved over time.

The third slide examines purchase drivers, highlighting the factors that influenced customers to buy from Campaign 6, making it successful. Factors such as higher income and not having children contributed to increased sales. On the other hand, the chart also identifies reasons for decreased sales, particularly when buyer income is less than Rs 41,000.
